# Development Commands & Bun Package Manager

## Primary Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev
# or
bun dev

# Build for production
bun run build
# or  
bun build

# Export presentation
bun run export
# or
bun export
```

## Package Management with Bun
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Add new dependency
bun add <package-name>

# Add dev dependency  
bun add -d <package-name>

# Remove dependency
bun remove <package-name>
```

## Important Bun Usage Notes
- **Always use bun instead of npm** for this project
- Scripts in [package.json](mdc:package.json) are configured for bun
- Deployment configs ([netlify.toml](mdc:netlify.toml), [vercel.json](mdc:vercel.json)) use `bun run build`
- Bun provides faster package installation and script execution
- Use `bun run <script-name>` or `bun <script-name>` for npm scripts

## Development Workflow
1. Install dependencies: `bun install`
2. Start dev server: `bun run dev` (keep running manually)
3. Edit slides in individual files within `slides/` directory
4. Changes auto-reload in browser with dev server running
5. Build for production: `bun run build` (only when ready to deploy)

## Development Notes
- **Dev server runs continuously**: Keep `bun run dev` running manually
- **No need to restart**: Only suggest running dev commands when explicitly asked
- **Auto-reload**: Changes to slide files automatically refresh in browser
- **Focus on content**: Edit individual slide files in `slides/` directory
